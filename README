NAME
       sscc - Secure Shipping Container Code algorithm

SYNOPSIS
       sscc [-dvs] string(s)

DESCRIPTION
       sscc  is  a tool for generating check digits from strings given at com-
       mand line. It implements SSCC (serial shipping  container  code)  check
       digit  used  by  all industries using bar codes.  And also comes with a
       variant of Luhn's algorithm, which is used by the credit card industry.
       It mainly serves educational purposes.

OPTIONS
       sscc recognizes the following options:

       -d     debug mode.

       -v     print version.

       -s     strict  mode.  Only generate SSCC check digits for input strings
              of the correct length, as specified  by  GS1.org,  i.e.   GTIN-8
              (7),  GTIN-12  (11), GTIN-13 (12), GTIN-14 (13), GSIN (16), SSCC
              (17).

       To give no option at all is fine, as long as you provide at  least  one
       parameter.
